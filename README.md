# legacy-remote

Legacy remote on React 18 + React Router 7, shares nothing: the host mounts it through MF Bridge.
Exposes `./RemoteRoot`, `./RemoteBridge`, `./runtime`, `./preload`. Builds with `@portal-poc/vite-config`.

## Local setup

One-time (see the platform repository for the full guide):

```sh
# ~/.npmrc — internal scope from GitHub Packages (token needs read:packages)
@portal-poc:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<token>
```

All repositories side by side: `~/projects/portal-poc/{platform,registry,host,tasks-remote,legacy-remote}`.

## Run

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev     # :5175
```

## Deploy

Nothing deploys by itself: **Actions → Deploy → Run workflow**, pick the stand and the branch or tag. Rules (checked
before the build, see platform `docs/branching.md`): `dev3` takes any branch and is overwritten in place; `dev2` the
newest `release/X.Y` or its tags, `dev1` the pilot line; `tst` only via "Promote" in the registry.

Locally, against the PoC infra (the same command the pipeline runs):

```sh
export PORTAL_REGISTRY_DIR=~/projects/portal-poc/registry PORTAL_NEXUS_USER=poc PORTAL_NEXUS_PASSWORD=poc
pnpm dlx @portal-poc/cli@2 deploy --stand dev3 --mode bridge   # main → dev3 snapshot (no release lines here yet)
```
